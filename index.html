                    <p>Aroa is an excellent teacher who uses a very well-structured lesson format that scaffolds children’s learning while actively engaging them. Aroa doesnt have the kids on mute so they are able to freely comment as they would in a small group conversation and they all take turns contributing to the debate. My daughter and I highly recommend this class!</p>

                    <p>Our 7 year old daughter really enjoys this class. She has a sense of accomplishment from completing a different writing task each week. She says that Ms Cain is funny and she likes seeing the other students in the class. From a parent perspective we like the friendly and patient teaching style of Ms Cain. We also like that the classes have a clear and manageable goal and that our daughter is always excited to run out of the class and show us what she has written.</p>

                    <p>Teacher Aroa is a great writing teacher for us. My child has a hard time using the past tense in her writing. After she learned about it with Ms Cain, now she started to use the past tense.</p>

        <section id="teaching-philosophy">
            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I believe students learn best when they feel seen, supported, and challenged. My classrooms are caring and structured spaces where every child can grow in confidence and communication.</p>
                <p>Having taught internationally for over 15 years, I approach each class with flexibility and cultural sensitivity. I love learning about my students’ languages and cultures so lessons honor who they are — and so their first language becomes a bridge to mastering a second one. I set clear goals and celebrate each success to build confidence and a genuine love of learning. I also believe strong communication with families is essential; when teachers and parents work together, students thrive.</p>
                <p>Collaboration and continuous learning are at the heart of my practice. I love exploring new research in neuroscience and language development, especially how multilingualism supports cognitive growth, critical thinking, and content learning. This ongoing study keeps my teaching fresh, evidence-based, and responsive to students’ needs.</p>
                <p>Above all, I value empathy, curiosity, and resilience — qualities I strive to model every day and to nurture in my students as they learn to understand themselves, connect with others, and engage thoughtfully with the world.</p>
